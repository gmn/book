TODO
------------
todo (no arguments)     - prints the items in 'now'|'today' list
todo arg{non-flag}      - find matching list
todo --flag

C) write a todolist management tool in python, that has
    - commands for shifting priority,
    - inserting items at random spots in a hierarchy and moving them around,
    - deprecating, activating, deactivating, and grouping easily.
    - So I can write:

        'todo home'
        'todo work',
        'todo'          -- by itself prints default list: "now".
                            and "todo --help for help"
        'todo all'      --shows all items from all categories.

        'todo programming'  --keep track of my programming related tasks,


        'todo startup' or 'todo business' to keep track of business ideas,

        'todo writing'

        todo startup programming   --items in ( programming ^ startup ) intersection

        todo coding     -- coding is alias for programming


A) hacking up a high-quality C++ library of functions and boiler-plate,
    STL allocator, string class, etc.

B) crypto library hacking. Learn and implement some of the protocols.
    See if for instance I could write Axolotl in CPP.
